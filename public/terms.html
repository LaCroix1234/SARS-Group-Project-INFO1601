                    <br>

                    <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should
                        therefore make sure
                        that you read them carefully before using the app. You are not allowed to copy or modify any
                        part of the app, or
                        our trademarks in any way. You are not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the app.
                        You also should not try
                        to translate the app into other languages, or make derivative versions. The app itself, and all
                        the trade marks, copyright,
                        database rights and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to INFO-1601
                        Project.
                    </p>

                    <p>INFO-1601 Project is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible.
                        For that reason, we
                        reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any time and for
                        any reason. We will never
                        charge you for the app or its services without making it very clear to you exactly what you’re
                        paying for.
                    </p>

                    <p> The SARS app stores and processes personal data that you have provided to us, in order to
                        provide our service.
                        It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the app secure. We therefore recommend
                        that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of
                        removing software restrictions and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your
                        device. It could make your
                        phone vulnerable to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security
                        features and it could mean
                        that the SARS app won’t work properly or at all.

                    <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that INFO-1601 Project will not take
                        responsibility for. Certain
                        functions of the app will require the app to have an active internet connection. The connection
                        can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but INFO-1601 Project
                        cannot take responsibility for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have
                        access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t
                        have any of your data allowance left.
                    </p>



                    <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
                        agreement with your
                        mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile
                        provider for the cost of data for
                        the duration of the connection while accessing the app, or other third party charges. In using
                        the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
                        charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without
                        turning off data roaming. If
                        you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the app, please be aware that we
                        assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the app.
                    </p>

                    <p>Along the same lines, INFO-1601 Project cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the
                        app i.e. You need to
                        make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
                        avail the Service, INFO-1601 Project cannot accept responsibility.
                    </p>

                    <p>With respect to INFO-1601 Project’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using the
                        app, it’s important to
                        bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times,
                        we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to
                        you.
                        INFO-1601 Project accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a
                        result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.
                    </p>

                    <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android &amp; iOS
                        – the requirements for
                        both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the app to)
                        may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep
                        using the app. INFO-1601 Project does not promise that it will always update the app so that it
                        is relevant to you
                        and/or works with the Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However,
                        you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may
                        also wish to stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving
                        notice of termination to you.
                        Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you
                        in these terms will end;
                        (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your device.

                        You will be notified of any changes by email or notification through the app. You may read the
